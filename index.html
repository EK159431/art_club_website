    <h1 class="titleBox">Art Club</h1>

    <p class="textBox">Art Club is a place to gather students and inspiring artists
      to have fun and create art. Ranging from learning skills, working with
      different mediums, to participating in regular and seasonal events, all
      these things and more are available to any students who want to join.
      No matter if you are  experienced, or know very little about art, there is
      a place for you.</p>

    <p class="textBox">The Art Clubs will come together for events such as
      fundraisers and big projects. The clubs want to encourage all kids from
      each art type to work aside one another.</p>
